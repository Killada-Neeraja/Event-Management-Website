# Event-Management-Website
# Upcoming Events Page 📅

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a simple, single-page HTML website designed to display a list of upcoming events. It is structured using basic HTML and inline CSS to create a dark-mode theme with white text, providing clear visibility for event details, a photo gallery, and contact information.

This page serves as a basic template for event registration or informational portals.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dark Mode Theme:** Uses a black background and white text (`bgcolor="black"` and `style="color: white;"`) for a visually distinct user experience.
* **Event Listing:** Dedicated sections for individual events with titles, descriptions, and key details.
* **Photo Gallery Link:** Includes a placeholder event with an image and a title (`Photo Galley Event`).
* **External Link Example:** Features a linked event title (`Fashion Store`) that directs to an external website (Myntra in this example).
* **Contact Information:** Clear, formatted contact details for collaboration or inquiries at the bottom of the page.
* **Semantic Structure:** Uses standard HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<hr>`) to organize content.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and content.
* **CSS (Inline):** For basic styling (color, background).

## 🖼️ Structure & Layout

The page is divided into the following main sections, all centered on the screen:

1.  **Header:** Title, tagline, and introductory paragraph.
2.  **Event 1 (Photo Galley):** Event details, rules, and placeholder image.
3.  **Event 2 (Fashion Store):** Linked event title, details, and placeholder image.
4.  **Footer/Contact:** Contact number, email, and address.
